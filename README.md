# The Code Awakens
The goal of this project is to create a collection of wallpapers that can help kids understand and memorize the basics of JavaScript language. They typically recreate quotes, characters and scenes from the Star Wars universe to reinforce basic programming concepts.
I am currently using images in the public domain (like US stamps and clipart) but contributions in this area will be most welcomed.
